The classic Mastermind game.

Player vs Computer 

The computer chooses four random colors. The player must guess these colors within 12 turns. The player can reverse roles with the computer.

After each guess, the player is given feedback in the form of a white or black response. "White" means a correct color, but in the wrong position. "Black" means a correct color in the right position.
